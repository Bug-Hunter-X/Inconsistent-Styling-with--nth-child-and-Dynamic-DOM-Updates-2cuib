The CSS rule `:nth-child(n)` selector can lead to unexpected behavior when dealing with dynamically generated content or changes to the DOM structure.  For instance, if you use `:nth-child(odd)` to style every other element, and you later add or remove elements, the styling might become incorrect without re-applying the CSS.  This happens because `:nth-child` recalculates its index based on the current element's position in the DOM.
